# Cognitive States Data Structure (CSDS): Represents information about
# the writer's cognitive state and the text from which we have gleaned
# this information.
# Basic information per CSDS instance:
# - the text
# - the proposition in the text about which we record the cognitive state;
#     we represent this by the start and end of the syntactic headword of the
#     proposition
# - the belief value; the values used are corpus-specific (or experiment-specific),
#     for example CB, NCB, ROB, NA
# - the sentiment value; the values used are corpus-specific (or experiment-specific),
#     for example pos, neg

# Many more fields will be added as we go along.

        3. added polarity. Its possible values:positive, negative, both, neutral, 
        uncertain-positive, uncertain-negative, uncertain-both, uncertain-neutral.
        4. added intensity. Its possible values: low, medium, high, extreme.

        6. added Enum for Type of annotation.
